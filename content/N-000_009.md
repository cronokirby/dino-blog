A French literary movement in the [19th Century](N-000_00A), with an emphasis
on realism, and a critical and expansive outlook on contemporary society.
At the time, France was undergoing rapid social change, as the political
regime stabilized after the chaotic post-Napoleonic era,
and the industrial revolution upended the organization of the economy.

# Zola and Social Genealogy

[Ã‰mile Zola](A-000_001) is, in my opinion, the archetypical author of
the movement.
In his [Rougon-Macquart series of novels](N-000_00B), he explores the history of
a family through the point of view of individual members throughout the century.
Each of them experiences the upheaveal of the society Zola lived in, and he
tries to portray this upheaval in a detailed and analytical way,
presenting not only the character's view of events, but also how each French social
class interacts with the phenomena.

For example, in [Germinale](R-000_003), Zola describes a mining town, whose
squalid working conditions eventually result in a general strike.
His depiction of events is not restricted just to the main character, a young worker,
but also to the family of French elites who are shareholders in the mine,
the older workers, the Parisian engineers, as well as the women in the families involved.
