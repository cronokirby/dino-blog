In general, information about a technical topic is disseminated:
- as speculative and uncertain notes among a small group,
- as precise and confident predictions among a larger technical group,
- as vague and less detailed assertions in mass media.

Conversely, new information will be found much earlier in
specialized circles than in general ones.
Much information never actually breaks out of this bubble into mass media.
When it does, important details are often missing.

# Examples

Some instances of this phenomenon (among many others):

- [housing reform, YIMBYism](N-000_007)
- [California's home insurance crisis](N-000_006)
