In the same way that [language constrains thought]([[N-000_002]]),
the tools you use to organize your writing and thinking constrain it.
The tools mold your thoughts.
Their shape constrains and guides them.
These constraints may not be fully binding, but they will leave their mark
in the end result.

Because of this, [there can be no universal tool for thought]([[N-000_003]])
