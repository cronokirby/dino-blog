Humans are more naturally adapted to fuzzy thinking than we are to formal thinking.
We have highly-developed visual processing which allows us to intuitively
assess situations, and track many actors in a dynamic environment.
These systems are inherently fuzzy.
We make mistakes in our judgement, but it is rapid, and capable of processing
a lot of information.

Humans can be taught subconscious skills.
We can learn how to do things whose operations or mechanisms we can't explain.
We can intuit the trajectory of a baseball much faster than we can calculate
it.
For example, consider humans learning to identify the sex of chicks.
A more benign kind of skill is that relating to physical activity.
Learning to become good at a sport, or to engage muscles more effectively in running
is not effectively taught through formal instruction, but rather through
intuitive experimentation.
