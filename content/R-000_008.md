An explanatory blog post arguing that
[Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange](N-000_014) inevitably leads to the variant using
elliptic curves.

The crux of the argument stems from the need for the key-exchange to be computable.
A useful model of computation here is that you manipulate field elements,
in some field $\mathbb{F}$.
Conceptually, if your computer stores field elements in memory,
and computes using arithmetic circuits,
what you have is equivalent to the category with objects tuples
$\mathbb{F}^n$, and a map $\mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m$
is just $m$ polynomials, over $n$ variables, with coefficients in
$\mathbb{F}$.

A group that we can use for diffie-hellman key-exchange is then just
a [group object](N-000_017) in this category.

This category is equivalent to that of [affine varieties](N-000_015).
For the case of elliptic curves, you also need
[projective varities](N-000_016).
This isn't an issue for our computational motivation, because
the maps between projective varieties embed as maps between
affine varieties, adding a dimension.

If you consider the group objects in the category of varieties,
the simplest ones are precisely the elliptic curves.
Increasing the dimension seems to make computation more difficult without
adding any security.
