If [writing tools constrain thought](N-000_001), then certainly "tools for thought"
constrain thought in the same way.
Your choice of tool matters.
A good tool for thought should be designed to support a definite kind of thinking.

Your thinking is personal.
A tool for thought should support *your* thinking.
It should be adapted to your personal methodology.

Synthesizing these two points, tools for thought must be developed in conjunction
with the personal methodology creating them.
Without this, you have an cognitive gap between the tool-maker and the augmented user.
Whereas other applications might be consumable, creative processes are fundamentally
productive, and require much deeper cognitive synergy.
