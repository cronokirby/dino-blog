In the totalitarian condition, information is political, and treated
with skepticism.
Whether information is true is the least important consideration.
Instead, we consider its beneficiaries:
Who is disseminating it?
Are they a friend?
Are they an enemy?
Most importantly: who gains power from this information spreading.
