For a system to become more complex, it requires surplus resources beyond
what are need for its maintenance.
For example, civilizations need an economic surplus in order to advance
in technology.
You need to have spare capacity beyond sustaining the population that you
can dedicate to investing in the future, researching new technology,
and other endeavours that are not strictly required for short-time survival.

As a consequence, looking at the return on investment of economic activity
becomes important, because the economic multiplier provides a limit on growth.
In particular, the [energy efficiency](N-000_012) of a system provides
a hard limit on growth.
If it requires a lot of energy merely to extract a tiny bit more energy
out of the resources you have at your disposition, your civilizational
growth rate is severely stifled.
