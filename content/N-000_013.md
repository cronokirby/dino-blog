Information-producing systems involve the gathering of information,
and its application to tthe discovery of new, valuable information.
Like other investments, [progress requires surplus]([[N-000_011]]).
When you have informational surplus, the application of information
quickly yields new, valuable information.

More concerning is the state in which your networks of information
production are so saturated that the rate of informational return
on investment is low.
One cause of this can be low entropy of information.
If most information you can find is tightly distributed
around information you already have, then it takes a lot of exploration
in order to discover novel facts.

Many online ecosystems have these dynamics,
diluting information, regressing it towards the mean as it [popularizes]([[N-000_005]]).
This results in an ecosystem in which information is stagnant, discovery is difficult,
and there is little surplus with which to progress.
